      "Author(s): Sebastian Raschka\n",
      "Description: Learn how to create, train, and tweak large language models (LLMs) by building one from the ground up! In Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch) bestselling author Sebastian Raschka guides you step by step through creating your own LLM. Each stage is explained with clear text, diagrams, and examples. You’ll go from the initial design and creation, to pretraining on a general corpus, and on to fine-tuning for specific tasks. Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch) teaches you how to: • Plan and code all the parts of an LLM • Prepare a dataset suitable for LLM training • Fine-tune LLMs for text classification and with your own data • Use human feedback to ensure your LLM follows instructions • Load pretrained weights into an LLM Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch) takes you inside the AI black box to tinker with the internal systems that power generative AI. As you work through each key stage of LLM creation, you’ll develop an in-depth understanding of how LLMs work, their limitations, and their customization methods. Your LLM can be developed on an ordinary laptop, and used as your own personal assistant. About the technology Physicist Richard P. Feynman reportedly said, “I don’t understand anything I can’t build.” Based on this same powerful principle, bestselling author Sebastian Raschka guides you step by step as you build a GPT-style LLM that you can run on your laptop. This is an engaging book that covers each stage of the process, from planning and coding to training and fine-tuning. About the book Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) is a practical and eminently-satisfying hands-on journey into the foundations of generative AI. Without relying on any existing LLM libraries, you’ll code a base model, evolve it into a text classifier, and ultimately create a chatbot that can follow your conversational instructions. And you’ll really understand it because you built it yourself! What's inside • Plan and code an LLM comparable to GPT-2 • Load pretrained weights • Construct a complete training pipeline • Fine-tune your LLM for text classification • Develop LLMs that follow human instructions About the reader Readers need intermediate Python skills and some knowledge of machine learning. The LLM you create will run on any modern laptop and can optionally utilize GPUs. About the author Sebastian Raschka is a Staff Research Engineer at Lightning AI, where he works on LLM research and develops open-source software. The technical editor on this book was David Caswell. Table of Contents 1 Understanding large language models 2 Working with text data 3 Coding attention mechanisms 4 Implementing a GPT model from scratch to generate text 5 Pretraining on unlabeled data 6 Fine-tuning for classification 7 Fine-tuning to follow instructions A Introduction to PyTorch B References and further reading C Exercise solutions D Adding bells and whistles to the training loop E Parameter-efficient fine-tuning with LoRA\n",

      "Author(s): Merve Hickok\n",
      "Description: This book is an early warning to public officials, policymakers, and procurement practitioners on the impact of AI on the public sector. Many governments have established national AI strategies and set ambitious goals to incorporate AI into the public infrastructure, while lacking AI-specific procurement guidelines. AI is not traditional software, and traditional processes are not sufficient to meet the challenges AI brings. Today’s decisions to embed AI and algorithmic systems into public system infrastructure can – and will – have serious repercussions in the future. The promise of AI systems is to make the public sector more efficient, effective, fair, and sustainable. However, AI systems also bring new and emerging risks which can impact rights and freedoms. Therefore, guardrails are necessary to consider the socio-technical dimensions and impact on individuals, communities, and society at large. It is crucial that public sector decision-makers understand the emerging risks of AI systems, the impact on the agency and the wider public infrastructure, and have the means to independently validate vendor claims. This book is a result of interviews with more than 20 public procurement professionals across countries, offering an in-depth analysis of the risks, incidents, governance practices, and emerging good practices around the world, and provides valuable procurement policy and process recommendations to address and mitigate these risks.\n",
